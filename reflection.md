 A new thing we learned was how to incorporate ASCII images into our game. Ash took the lead on this, searching around for how to write methods that would correctly print out the images, and then generated text files for each image we wanted to show. This turned out to be a big hit — everyone we showed the game to was very impressed, and it made people more immersed and invested in the game.  

 Some of the best pieces of feedback we got while working on this project were on small things, such as directions or places that we hadn't considered including in our game. When we played to test things, we always knew exactly what to type in to get the right outcomes and move the game along. When other people played, they often did things that we saw as counter-intuitive, but that they saw as obvious or just as valid as our "right" moves. For example, one of Lucy's friends was confused as to why one the most prominent celestial bodies — the Sun — wasn't an object, according to our game. Lucy went in shortly after and added the sun, expanding the scope of our project. By taking in this feedback, we were able to grow the game, making it more complete and more fun for people other than us two. 

 If we could go back in time and give our past selves advice about this project, we might say to constrain our goals a bit. Early in the project, we had a lot of superfluous attributes and methods that didn't add anything to the game — such as allowing the user to dig on planets, or having rations on the spaceship. These attributes may have worked in a different game, but they were completely irrelevant to our final product. While it wasn't a giant waste of time — many of these aspects were just a few lines of code — it may have kept us from expanding our project in other, better ways. It would've been best to focus first on the overarching structure of the game and the details necessary to build it, before worrying about tiny details that may or may not make it into the final product. 

 Our team dynamic made this project easier for the both of us. At this point in the semester, we were well-equipped to work with each other, as we had been doing homework assignments together since September. We understood how the other person worked, what their strengths were, and how to effectively communicate. This made the actual workflow incredibly smooth. We would each work on parts of the project separately, before coming back together during class to talk about the best next steps. Ash took the lead on a lot of the coding parts of the project, establishing the do/while structure and some important methods (like the ASCII art and the input scanning method). Lucy took the lead on a lot of the documentation/details of the project, such as JavaDoc comments. However, there was definetely lots of overlap: no one did any part of the project entirely alone, or without support from the other.
